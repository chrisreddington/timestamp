# Manual Deployment Workflow (Break Glass)
#
# PURPOSE: Emergency deployment bypassing CI/CD checks
#
# Use this workflow when:
# - CI/CD is blocked but deployment is critical
# - Quick hotfix deployment needed
# - Testing deployment process itself
#
# ⚠️ WARNING: This bypasses all quality checks (tests, linting, type checking)
# Only use when you're confident the code is deployment-ready.
#
# For normal deployments, use the CI/CD workflow which runs full validation.
